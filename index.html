                2013 was a big year for games in general but especially in the horror space. Among hits like The Last of
                Us, Luigi's Mansion: Dark Moon, The Walking Dead: 400 Days and Amnesia: A Machine for Pigs many would
                argue that the best horror game of said year was the first of the trilogy: Outlast. </p>

                    <h2>The Story</h2>
                    <p>
                        Outlast is a AAA (triple-A) game released by an indie studio Red Barrel on 4th of September
                        2013. It was the first of its kind to feature found footage and making the camera an integral
                        part of the gameplay. The story features a reporter Miles Upshur who receives an email by Waylon
                        Park, a software engineer at Murkoff Corp, about the wrong doings, budget cutting and patient
                        abuse at the company. That piques Miles' interest and is also the main motivation for him
                        venturing into Mount Massive Asylum. Said building is a real place located in the remote
                        mountains of Lake County, Colorado, USA. With this information Miles wants to get the 'big
                        scoop,'' hence the usage of a camcorder. The camera can be used in two separate ways, firstly
                        Miles can use it to record evidence of Murkoff's crimes and secondly it can be used to navigate
                        the darkness with its 'night-vision' setting which adds to the horror atmosphere.

                    <h2>Review</h2>
                    <p>
                        I first became aware of Outlast at 12 years old. PewDiePie was the main reason why I became
                        interested in the horror game genre in the first place. I remember it being overly scary however
                        I did not have the means to play it myself and I was also too scared. Now, 11 years later, I
                        finally worked up the courage (and got a better PC) to play it for myself. It surprisingly still
                        holds up not only as a horror game but also as a speed-running game since there is plenty of fun
                        glitches to exploit, which I have also tried out myself. The most common detriment of a horror
                        game is its lacklustre story, however, Outlast delivered in having a believable story (for the
                        most part) and interesting characters, and enemies who you could learn more about if you picked
                        up the confidential files scattered around the asylum. I have played both the original game and
                        the DLC: Whistleblower, and both are enjoyable. Many players, like myself, like the DLC better.
                        It is by no means a cash-grab and that is made clear by the pricing. The first two games of the
                        trilogy are affordable on steam for 19,50€ and 8,79€ each.

            <p id="nasredini">Whether you are interested in the story, speed-running or just want to play an excellent horror game for
                an affordable price, Outlast is sure to be a good pick.</p>

            <h4> Score: <strong> 9/10 </strong></h4>
